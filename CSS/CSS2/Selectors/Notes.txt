CSS Selectors
================

CSS selectors are used to select the HTML elements that a style will be applied to. A selector consists of a pattern used to match elements in the document tree.

Types of Selectors
-------------------

### Universal Selector

*   The universal selector is represented by an asterisk symbol (\*). It matches all elements in the document tree.

### Type Selectors

*   Type selectors are used to select elements of a particular type. For example, to select all <p> elements, the selector would be p.

### Class Selectors

*   Class selectors are used to select elements that have a particular class. For example, to select all elements with the class "header", the selector would be .header.

### ID Selectors

*   ID selectors are used to select elements that have a particular id. For example, to select an element with the id "header", the selector would be #header.

### Attribute Selectors

*   Attribute selectors are used to select elements that have a particular attribute. For example, to select all elements with the attribute "href", the selector would be [href].

### Combinators

*   Combinators are used to combine multiple selectors. For example, to select all <p> elements that are children of a <div> element, the selector would be div p.

### Pseudo-classes

*   Pseudo-classes are used to select elements that are in a particular state. For example, to select all elements that are currently being hovered over, the selector would be :hover.

### Pseudo-elements

*   Pseudo-elements are used to select parts of an element. For example, to select the first line of a <p> element, the selector would be p::first-line.

Selector Combinations
----------------------

*   Selectors can be combined to select elements that match multiple criteria. For example, to select all <p> elements that are children of a <div> element and have the class "header", the selector would be div p.header.

Selector Precedence
-------------------

*   The order in which selectors are written can affect the final result. The last selector in a list will override any previous selectors that match the same element.

Selector Precedence Rules
-------------------------

*   The universal selector has the lowest precedence.
*   Type selectors have a higher precedence than the universal selector.
*   Class selectors have a higher precedence than type selectors.
*   ID selectors have a higher precedence than class selectors.
*   Attribute selectors have a higher precedence than ID selectors.
*   Combinators have a higher precedence than attribute selectors.
*   Pseudo-classes have a higher precedence than combinators.
*   Pseudo-elements have a higher precedence than pseudo-classes.
